ForceFocus

Project Overview: Created a Google Chrome extension that tracks your calendar 
and blocks distracting websites if you have a class currently going on or a 
test coming up, used Google APIs and Javascript. 

Conclusion: It was pretty cool getting to learn how the Google APIs worked as
well as expanding my knowledge of Javascript, specifically around 
asynchronous calls to the APIs. 

Future: In the future, I would like to finish up the integration with Google 
Calendar as well as clean up the UI for the popup.
